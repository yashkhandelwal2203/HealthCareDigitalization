            <p>“We believe consumer health technologies — apps, wearables, self-diagnosis tools — have the potential to
                strengthen the patient-physician connection and improve health outcomes.”
                <br>
                - Dr. Glen Stream, Chairman, Family Medicine for America's Health
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> “In 10 years the electronic medical record will be the minor player, in terms of where a person's health
                history lives. Most of that information will be kept on the phone or in a secure cloud, and the patient
                will be highly engaged with collecting, curating and sharing that data. Most doctor visits will be like
                calling up a YouTube meets virtual human docs and there will also be an aspect of virtual reality.”

                <p>As for the healthcare industry, the term digital transformation means how an organization uses
                    technologies and digital solutions to improve the patient experience, streamline operations, and
                    make
                    on-demand patient care more accessible and cheaper.
                    <br>

                    Technological advancements like electronic health records, online appointments, telemedicine, SaMD
                    (Software as a Medical Device) and Al-powered medical devices are all examples of digitalization in
                    the
                    healthcare industry.
                    <br>
                    These technologies totally reshape how patients communicate with health experts, how their
                    information
                    is divided between suppliers, and how choices are made about their treatment plans.

        <h1>What Digital Solutions are Emerging in Healthcare ?</h1>
        <p>The possibilities that digital strategies present when it comes to healthcare are virtually unlimited.
            Digital technologies have the potential to make healthcare more flexible and accessible to those most in
            need.
            Let's explore some of the ways that healthcare companies can enhance their organization with strategic
            digital solutions. </p>


        <div class="dfd">

                <h2>Digital front door</h2>
                A digital front door is a concept that emerged as a result of the digital revolution. Some patients may
                no longer be opening the physical door to a practice or organization. Instead, they are engaging through
                digital means. The digital front door may be a website, mobile app, patient portal, or other technology.
                But regardless of how a patient engages with their provider, the front door must be accessible. Patients
                are already likely seeking a healthcare provider because they have an ailment, so the point of entry
                needs to be easy. Creating a digital front door requires strategic thinking because it's more than
                “just” the website that needs to be updated. It's an entire experience that must be seamless across all
                channels.</p>
            </div>
        </div>


        <div class="dfd">
            <div class="para1">
                <p>
                <h2>Patient data analysis</h2>
                While new digital technologies can create more efficient, and safe engagements for patients and
                healthcare providers, these tools are nothing without data. Healthcare practices need to incorporate
                data analysis into their approach when thinking through their digital strategy to help them spot trends,
                patterns, and opportunities that they otherwise miss, helping them to better serve their patient
                populations and communities at large.

                <p>
                <h2>Wearables that track patient data points</h2>
                Digital solutions in healthcare can also include wearable devices that monitor and relay a patient's
                vital signs and telemedicine options for those too sick or contagious to meet with the doctor in person.
                And with items like the Fitbit, Apple Watch, and other tech becoming more common and accessible to a
                greater pool of people, this may be the easier way for both patients and clinicians to track and create
                a healthcare plan.</p>

                <p>
                <h2>Mobile apps for virtual telehealth visits</h2>
                Virtually every kind of company today has a mobile app of some sort, and healthcare will soon be no
                different. COVID-19 expedited this need by forcing the hands of HCPs to invest in a new mobile app or
                enhance the one they already had so that patient visits were seamless. As time marches on, mobile apps
                will begin to become a go-to resource for many patients and healthcare providers. That's because mobile
                apps enhance healthcare experiences by making healthcare providers' lives more efficient, helping them
                better manage their patients and see more people effectively. This is beneficial for both the provider
                and their patients because it helps more patients get the treatments they need. .</p>

            To summarize, the digital revolution has been affecting and reshaping health care systems worldwide. It
            encompasses the changes of the fundamental principles and approaches of medical service and education. It
            was shown that the application of novel digital innovations can improve the accessibility, quality, and
            flexibility of healthcare for the public not only in Western countries but also in developing countries as
            well. For example, telemedicine helps people from rural and remote regions to get high-quality consulting,
            diagnostics, and treatment.
            <br>
            <br>
            However, there is a range of questions to be answered prior to the wide implementation of digital health
            platforms. It encompasses the clinical effectiveness of the proposed technologies and their validation. The
            second issue is the reliability and safety of such digital health innovations. It implies meticulous testing
            and set-up clinical studies according to ethical principles [145]. Due to the lack of official regulations
            and recommendations, the stakeholders, including private and governmental organizations, are facing the
            problem of adequate validation and approbation of novel digital health technologies. In this regard, proper
            scientific research is required before a digital product is deployed for the healthcare sector.
